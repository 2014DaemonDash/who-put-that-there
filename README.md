Github repo setup
==================

Since only Andrew Maki was able to access this repo, we have decided to do a single final commit at the end. In the mean time, we committed and made changes on repos I made under my own account. I will leave them up for open viewing. 

Unfortuantely, my team has also made some mistakes and has encountered multiple problems when dealing with Github. Due to these problems, one may find 2 difference project repositories under my own account, makstermaki. I would also like to note that in this repository, the 2014DaemonDash repo, two separate projects were committed. DaemonDashApp is the project my team has coded while sdkDemo was a separate project containing a barcode scanning library which we used. Thus, both of these projects have been committed to this repo.
